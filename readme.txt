== OUR USERS LOVE IT! ==

We are proud to have near perfect 5/5 score on Trustpilot:

*“I think it's a great app for keeping track of your sail trips, both past, current and future. Unlike most (or rather all) apps, the map can be embedded on other websites. Also love the track details,”* - L.Delboca

*“We are very happy with our new website and Alain has been a real star helping us build it and making modifications to suit our needs. For us, one of the main attractions is that we can send photos to the website using email - even from our very slow IridiumGo. Alain has always been very quick with responses to our requests and has given very good explanations and guidance.”* - Andrez Short S/V Kelper
